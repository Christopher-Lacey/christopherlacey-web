      <p>I created the <a href = "https://earthmusicguide.com">EarthMusicGuide</a> because I wanted to present a comprehensive and dynamic companion to the music of a strange beautiful planet.  I wanted to share these ideas in a straightforward and simple way that would be easily understood, universal, engaging, and fun.</p>

          <p>I became fascinated with music at a very early age and engaged with various musical instruments. I studied piano under Martha Boucher, guitar under Danny Strunk, and drums under Randy Everett.  I played in the marching and jazz bands at Bartlesville High School and also formed "rock and roll" bands.</p>

          <p>Subsequently, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. There I formed an original, experimental venture that combined rock, jazz, and drum n bass with Shree Shyam Elton Bradman, Robin Eckman, and Andy Woods called Transmitter.  I studied guitar during this period under Shan Kenner and Brian Stone.</p>
